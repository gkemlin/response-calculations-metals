Julia code performing the numerical simulation from our paper on robust response
calculations for metals, available on arXiv [insert link].
The framework described in this paper is implemented by default in
[DFTK](https://dftk.org). We run DFTK with MPI, see
[Timings and parallelization](https://docs.dftk.org/stable/tricks/parallelization/).

# Dependencies
Julia 1.7 with the following Julia libraries:
- [DFTK.jl](https://dftk.org) v0.5.5 for the simulation environment (this code
  might not work with more recent versions of DFTK);
- [ForwardDiff.jl](https://juliadiff.org/ForwardDiff.jl/stable/) for the
  generation of the perturbation `Î´V` from atomic displacements;
- MPI, LinearAlgebra for related computations;
- Dates, DataFrames, JLD2, JSON, PGFPlots, Latexify, LaTeXStrings
  for saving and reading results.

# Organisation
Numerical examples are gathered as follows:
- the silicon examples can be found in `silicon/`;
- the metallic examples can be found in `metals/system` where system is either
  `Al40` or `Fe2MnAl`, with default extra bands and with number of extra bands
  suggested by the adaptive algorithm from Section 6.
In each folder, you will find `.log` files of the SCF calculations, as well as the
response calculations, and `.json` files which store the data we need to
generate the plots.

# Usage
To perform the computations, first open the Julia shell with `julia --project`
from the location of this repository and then run
```
using Pkg
Pkg.instantiate()
```
to install the required dependencies.

To run the computations, two different cases arise:
- for silicon, open the Julia shell with `julia --project` from the `silicon/`
  folder and then run `include("silicon.jl")`;
- for the metals, first go, in your terminal, to the location of the system you
  want (e.g. `metals/Fe2MnAl`) and then run for instance
  `mpiexecjl -n 8 julia Fe2MnAl.jl`.  /!\ this can take a long time /!\

To generate all the plots from the paper, open the Julia shell with
`julia --project` from the location of this repository and then run
`include("all_plot.jl")`. Plots can be generated without running the
computations first as the `.json` files are already saved in the repo, and the
pdf files will be generated in the associated folders.

To run the adaptive algorithm from Section 6, open the Julia shell with
`julia --project` from the location of this repository and then run
`include("run_adaptive_algorithm.jl")`. Note thas this requires to first run
the computations for `Al40` et `Fe2MnAl` in order to generate the `scfres.jld`
files which store the data and are too large to be stored in the depo.
